# E-Commerce-Back-End-ORM
  
  ## Description
  My project is about utilizing API routes, models, mysql, and the seeds folder to create a back-end ecommerce, so that the user can add, update and delete by using servers
  
  
  ## Installation
  first you will have to go to your database folder and login into your mysql so that you can create the database, then once you've done that logout, then go back in you main folder and run npm run seed, so that all the data in the seeds folder can be pushed into your database and into your server. Once you done that you will now do npm run start and now your server is running.
